"""
Given an array of bird sightings where every element represents a bird type id, determine the id of the most frequently sighted type. If more than 1 type has been spotted that maximum amount, return the smallest of their ids.

Example

There are two each of types  and , and one sighting of type . Pick the lower of the two types seen twice: type .

Function Description

Complete the migratoryBirds function in the editor below.

migratoryBirds has the following parameter(s):

int arr[n]: the types of birds sighted
Returns

int: the lowest type id of the most frequently sighted birds
Input Format

The first line contains an integer, , the size of .
The second line describes  as  space-separated integers, each a type number of the bird sighted.

Constraints
5<=n>=2*10ˆ5
It is guaranteed that each type is 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.
Sample Input 0

6
1 4 4 4 5 3
Sample Output 0

4
Explanation 0

The different types of birds occur in the following frequencies:

Type :  bird
Type :  birds
Type :  bird
Type :  birds
Type :  bird
The type number that occurs at the highest frequency is type , so we print  as our answer.

Sample Input 1

1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1 3 4
Sample Output 1

3
Explanation 1

The different types of birds occur in the following frequencies:

Type : 
Type : 
Type : 
Type : 
Type : 
Two types have a frequency of , and the lower of those is type .
